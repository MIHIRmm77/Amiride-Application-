# AmiRide-Application
A ride sharing app 
The application features a structured user interface starting with a login page, where users can log in using their enrollment number and password, or sign up by providing basic details including name, contact number, and email. A "Forgot Password" feature is also available, allowing users to retrieve login credentials via SMS sent from their own device. Once logged in, users access a central Dashboard with key options — Publish Ride and Book Ride — along with a footer navigation bar providing quick access to Ride History and Account settings.
